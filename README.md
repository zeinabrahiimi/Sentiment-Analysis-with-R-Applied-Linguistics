# Steps to conduct a lexicon-based Sentiment Analysis with R and Visualize the result using Tableau Software”
    1. Loading packages and the data in R statistical software
    2. Preprocessing
    3. Sentiment Analysis
    4. Saving the output to the CSV file called “l_nrc_IELTS.csv”. In the end, I saved it as an Excel file and renamed it “words+sentiment”.
    5. Creating and saving the image of a grouped bar plot called “R” to visualize some of the words associated with each sentiment category
    6. Transforming the R output into Tableau to understand the sentiment patterns better
    • Creating a Horizontal bar chart (dragging the Sentiment column to the “Columns” and
    “Color” shelves and the "l_nrc_IELTS" column to the "Rows" shelf and
    ordering the sentiment categories in descending order).
    • Creating a Text table to see the frequency of each word based on its associated sentiment
    category.
